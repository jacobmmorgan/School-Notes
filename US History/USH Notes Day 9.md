- The most popular entertainment was shakespearean plays regardless of social class.

##### The Astor Place riots
Long simmering socio cultural tensions
Democrats versus whigs
Immigrants versus nativists
Working class versus upper and middle class

- The middle class was created, and thus theater owners charged higher prices to get rid of working class attendance.

##### Lola Montez
Arrived in 1851
Brought excitement and scandal with "spider dance"
Slept with married men, violated middle class values
Straddled the idea of democracy and entertainment

##### Early Middle-Class Literature

- Authors instructed readers on republican values
- Characteristics prized by the middle class: piety, chastity, loyalty, diligence, honesty
- Authors tried to define gender, racial, class, and moral boundaries
