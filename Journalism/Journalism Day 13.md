# Active voice vs Passive voice
###### ACTIVE VOICE
- Active voice writing is a style where  
the subject of a sentence performs  
the action, making the writing clearer,  
more direct, and often more concise.  
- Example: The dog chased the ball.  
###### PASSIVE VOICE  
- Passive voice writing is when the  
subject of a sentence receives an  
action, rather than performing it, often  
using a form of “to be.”  
- Example: The ball was chased by the  
dog.
