## Guest Speaker - James Reid

After graduating from UCLA, Reid got his start in a Los  
Angeles newsroom, where he worked for American  
Public Radio’s “Marketplace,” and went on to develop  
college marketing campaigns for Columbia/TriStar,  
Paramount, and Universal Pictures. He has served as a  
board member for several organizations, including the  
Northern California Chapter of the National Academy of  
Television Arts and Sciences., A FORMER NINE-TIME EMMY-  
WINNING TELEVISION EXECUTIVE  
PRODUCER AND DOCUMENTARY  
FILMMAKER. Reid spent the better part of two decades in his  
“childhood dream job” with CBS (KPIX-TV) in San  
Francisco.  
• He produced thousands of hours of local feature  
stories and programs — celebrating the people,  
places, history, and quirk of the Bay Area on  
“Evening Magazine” and “Eye on the Bay.”  
• He contributed and collaborated on content for  
“CBS Sunday Morning.” HIS LIFELONG PASSION FOR HYPER-LOCAL  
AND CHANGE-MAKING STORYTELLING  
OFTEN PAVED THE WAY FOR HIM TO BECOME  
PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN ELEVATING  
REGIONAL AND  
GLOBAL ISSUES. After leaving CBS, he wrote,  
directed, and produced  
“Minutes to Die,” a global  
documentary on the crisis of  
snakebite deaths in the most  
impoverished parts of the  
world.  
The film led to the World Health  
Organization taking on the  
issue as a high priority after  
years of neglect. HE WENT ON TO ESTABLISH THE GLOBAL  
SNAKEBITE INITIATIVE, A U.S.-BASED  
NONPROFIT CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A  
NEW ANTIVENOM FOR SUB-SAHARAN  
AFRICA.  
o HE HAS ALSO SPENT THE LAST 25 YEARS  
CREATING BASEBALL AND COMMUNITY-  
BUILDING DOCUMENTARIES FOR A  
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHARITY AND  
MLB ALUMNI. In the summer of 2025, Reid launched another passion project a 
pop-up bakery.  
He also continues to develop a “next generation” platform for Bay  
Area feature and travel storytelling.  
In his spare time, he can be found conducting oral histories of family  
and friends or in the kitchen, where he loves to chef for those who  
love to eat.
NO MATTER WHAT, TELLING  
STORIES IS AT THE CENTERPIECE  
OF IT ALL.
